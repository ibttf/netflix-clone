# Hover Effects and Slider 
So on each individual movie list container there is two arrows so when you click on right one it will slide over all the movies to the right and show you new ones and when you click on the left one it will bring you back to those original movies that we passed 

and on each movie we can hover over each one and it will expand and show us buttons and also the movies name and genre
