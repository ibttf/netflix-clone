 # Nav bar
Our Navbar activates on scroll and will send you to different links depending on the items being clicked. So far, we have a working "my list" and "search" page which will allow you to search for movies and see which ones are in your list.

#Slider
In each row of movies, we've included a slider that will appear when you hover over a row. This slider will dynamically allow you to flip through each row of movies.

# Search bar 
In our search bar, you can search up titles of different movies and have them displayed.

# My List 
Our "My List" feature runs on a local db.json server and allows you to persist changes to and from the list. If you hover over any movie, it will ask you to add that movie item to "My List," which will then send a post request and add your movie, making it visible both in the "My List" row as well as the separate "My List tab." The add/delete button will also change dynamically depending on whether or not your movie is in "My List."

# Hover Effects  
Upon clicking on the "more info" dropdown of a movie, you are redirected to a separate page that displays information about each movie, including the description, cast, genres, different trailer videos, and even a row for recommended movies.
